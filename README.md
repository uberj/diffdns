Given two nameservers and some zone files, do the nameservers respond with the same information when asked about the data in the zone files? This tools does the asking and the comparing.

Requirements:
```
A patched version of iscpy  (see rpm/iscpy-1.0.3-1.noarch.rpm)
A patched version of dnspython (see rpm/dnspython-1.10.0-1.noarch.rpm)
```
